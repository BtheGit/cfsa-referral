# cfsa-referral

The [DC Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA)](https://cfsa.dc.gov/page/about-cfsa) is the public child welfare agency in the District of Columbia responsible for protecting child victims and those at risk of abuse and neglect and assisting their families.

The purpose of this project is to use CFSA program eligibility criteria to build a data entry interface that would return potential CFSA programs for referrals.
